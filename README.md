### The System and Software Architecture of Back-End Applications for the Short-Term Rental of Electric Scooters – Exhibition of an Exemplarily Implemented Back-End Application

<br>

## Abstract

The market for the short-term rental of electric scooters is currently rapidly
growing in many parts of the world.
As other short-term rental markets, mainly in form of the concept of car sharing,
and modern services in general have already shown, a mobile or web-based
application is the absolute tool for the functioning of such a service.

The main aspect of success for such a system is the _magic_ behind the scenes
that no customer sees. The users just see the electric scooter as the product and
want to be able to ride one on demand by the push of a button.
The ease of use for the customers and their satisfaction are the main facets
to be considered by the provider of such a service.

Oftentimes, this involves two foundational web-based components: A front-end and a back-end.
On the one hand, the front-end provides the user interface of
the product – the façade of the whole.
It is the component the customer interacts with but more importantly it is
what the users identify the product with.
On the other hand, the back-end is the brain of the software product,
it dictates what the front-end should do.
Meanwhile, it does not determine what it looks like.
If the front-end is unusable, the back-end will never be able to fix that as the
front-end becomes the mental representation of the whole product for the customers.
If the back-end behaves sluggish or is prone to errors, the front-end will not
be able to save much by the same token. In the end, both form a synergy with each other.

This thesis exhibits the back-end of such an application while focussing
on the system and software architecture of it.
This includes the functionalities that are mandatory and the question on
how the product will come together – from ideas and drafts to written source code.
