\section{Introduction}

The market for electric scooters is on the rise all over the world,
especially in East Asian countries like China. \cn
In Europe though, this market is still very underrepresented in our modern urban lives.\\
While it becomes sort of a commodity in big East Asian cities, in Europe this vehicle
is still more of a status symbol, partially due to its pricing.\cn \\
The definition of the word \emph{scooter} is fairly vague.
Some describe it as a small vehicle with a handlebar and a platform to stand on,
the kind traditionally children were riding.
This paper looks at the \emph{motorcycle-esque type} of a scooter though, and in
particular the electric versions of them.\\
Many pain points of combustion engines vanish with the switch to their electric
counterparts. Certainly, there are also new challenges that arise.
The maintenance of the mechanical system of the whole vehicle becomes easier.
There are less moving parts which makes for less errors.
On the downside, the exchange of the fuel causes the most problems with electric engines.
Of course they utilize batteries instead of fossil fuels as their impetus.
Although the invention of the battery is older than that of the
combustion engine \cn, the technology is still not perfected and sees new
advancements every year. Alas, it also combats many challenges in terms of
safety, cost, capacity, speed of recharging and longevity.\\
All theses challenges are partly to blame for the inferior sales of electric scooters
outside of East Asia. \cn

\section{German electric scooter manufacturer \emph{Kumpan}}

This thesis loosely focuses on the business of German electric scooter manufacturer \emph{Kumpan}.
The company was established in 2009. For their product, they concentrated on three main aspects:
an exterior design ready for the European market, build quality and sufficient cruising radius.
They finished building their first electric scooter in 2010 and are thriving for good products ever since.
The price of their electric scooters is still rather high. Owing to that circumstance,
they came up with smaller, cheaper models as well as a completely different approach.\\
Instead of traditional retail sales they started developing the idea of a
short-term rental service for their scooters. And from many angles it makes sense:
As seen in the last section, the market for the short-term rental of electric scooters
especially in Germany is still minuscule compared to e.g. car or bike sharing.
Meanwhile, the costs for buying an electric scooter are still relatively high.
Lastly, many people will not need such a vehicle for the whole day and would benefit
from more flexibility and parking spots are also a scarcity in our inner cities.
Therefore, \emph{Kumpan} plans to enter the market of short-term electric scooter rentals
in the near future in some form or the other.\\
There are still many aspects to be discussed and determined but one of them
is already set and can be seen as a necessity regardless of the final implementation:
A server back-end application as well as its infrastructure.
The handling of the short-term rental only becomes feasible with the automation
of as many processes as possible. This demands such an application ideally paired
with a front-end.
