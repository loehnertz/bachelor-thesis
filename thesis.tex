\section{Problem}

The market for electric scooters is on the rise all over the world,
especially in East Asian countries like China. \cn
In Europe though, this market is still very underrepresented in our modern urban lives.\\
While it becomes sort of a commodity in big East Asian cities, in Europe this vehicle
is still more of a status symbol, partially due to its pricing.\cn \\
The definition of the word \emph{scooter} is fairly vague.
Some describe it as a small vehicle with a handlebar and a platform to stand on,
the kind traditionally children were riding.
This paper looks at the \emph{motorcycle-esque type} of a scooter though, and in
particular the electric versions of them.\\
Many pain points of combustion engines vanish with the switch to their electric
counterparts. Certainly, there are also new challenges that arise.
The maintenance of the mechanical system of the whole vehicle becomes easier.
There are less moving parts which makes for less errors.
On the downside, the exchange of the fuel causes the most problems with electric engines.
Of course they utilize batteries instead of fossil fuels as their impetus.
Although the invention of the battery is older than that of the
combustion engine \cn, the technology is still not perfected and sees new
advancements every year. Alas, it also combats many challenges in terms of
safety, cost, capacity, speed of recharging and longevity.\\
All theses challenges are partly to blame for the inferior sales of electric scooters
outside of East Asia. \cn
